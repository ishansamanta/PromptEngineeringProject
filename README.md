# PromptEngineeringProject
This is a simple website hosted using firebase, and the source code of the HTML file is being provided in this repository. This project is a pure example of prompt engineering as the entire website is built with the help of AI tools. Design and logics were given by me and this website is a part of our upcoming Projects for team M.O.O.N.

## AIM OF THIS WEBSITE:
THIS WEBSITE LOCALLY COLLECTS WEATHER INFORS FROM A MENTIONED SITE AND DISPLAYS THEM IN OUR WEBSITE. It will ask the user to enter the name of the place and rest of the things are automatically handled.
